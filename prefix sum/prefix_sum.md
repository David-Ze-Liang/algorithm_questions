# Prefix Sum

### Question description:

Given an integer array of length n and m querys. Each query is a pair of *l* and *r*ï¼Œ and we want to know the sum from l-th to r-th elements(indluded) in the array.

see: <https://www.acwing.com/problem/content/797/>  

**Input:**
First line: integers n and m;  
Second line: n integers in the array;  
In the following m lines, each line contains two integers l and r.  
1 <= l <= r <= n;  
1 <= n,m <= 100000;  
-1000 <= element in the array <= 1000
```
